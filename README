This code is a prototype for an improved replacement of the random
sampling functionality in Phobos' std.random module.

The [R,r]andomSampleVitter structs and functions here are a copy of the
corresponding [R,r]andomSample API in std.random, with the underlying
functionality rewritten to use Jeffrey Scott Vitter's Algorithm D
(Vitter 1984, 1987).

Compile and run the program to see a series of benchmarks of the new
algorithm compared to the algorithm currently implemented in Phobos.
Make sure you have the latest development versions of DMD and Phobos
installed first.

To compile, either:

  make

or, if you don't have make installed,

  dmd -O -release -inline -ofrandomsample randomsample.d

Note that for demonstration purposes it is not recommended to compile
the program without these optimization flags, as otherwise the demo
benchmarks can take an extremely long time to run!
